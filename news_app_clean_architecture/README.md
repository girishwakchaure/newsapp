# news_app_clean_architecture

A clean architecture-based Flutter application that fetches real-time news from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/), supports offline caching using `sqflite`, and provides search functionality, a detailed article view, and responsive UI with light/dark theme support.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

This project follows **clean architecture** and is divided into:

### 📁 `data/`
- Handles API calls via `http`
- Uses `sqflite` for offline caching
- Includes model classes and repository implementation

### 📁 `domain/`
- Pure Dart layer with business logic
- Contains entities, use cases, and repository contracts

### 📁 `presentation/`
- UI layer built with Flutter
- Uses `flutter_riverpod` for state management
- Includes pages, providers, and reusable widgets

This separation improves code maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## 🧪 Assumptions / Trade-offs

- Used `http` to keep dependencies lightweight
- NewsAPI does not support offline mode, so I cached articles locally using `sqflite`
- Search is implemented on the client side for simplicity
